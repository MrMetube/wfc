  abstract = {The Delaunay tessellation in n-dimensional space is a space-filling aggregate of n-simplices. These n-simplices are the dual forms of the vertices in the commonly used Voronoi tessellation. Several efforts have been made to simulate the 2-dimensional Voronoi tessellation on the computer. Additional problems occur for the 3 and higher dimensional implementations but some of these can be avoided by alternatively computing the dual Delaunay tessellation. An algorithm that finds the topological relationships in these tessellations is given.},

  abstract = {An efficient algorithm is proposed for computing the Dirichlet tessellation and Delaunay triangulation in a k dimensional Euclidean space (k≥2). The algorithm is designed in a way that should allow it to be extended to some of the simpler non-Euclidean metric spaces as well. The algorithm has been implemented in ISO FORTRAN by the author and execution time and stereoscopic pictures of the tessellation and triangulation are presented at the end of this paper.},
